# Drag and Drop Shapes

Drag and Drop Shapes is a simple interactive web application that allows users to drag and drop various shapes (circles, ellipses, and squares) within a designated screen area. When a shape is dragged, the application calculates the closest shape to it and "snaps" the dragged shape to the closest shape's edges or center. This feature makes it easy for users to align and organize the shapes within the screen area.
